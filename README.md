<h1 align="center">Hi, Welcome to zsotroav's GitHub profile</h1>

I am a Computer Engineering student and an Educational assistant, messing around
with all sorts of random projects in (mostly) my free time, or as part of
University assignments, most of which are publicly available here on GitHub. I
occasionally work on private commissions or help out in other open-source
projects.

I mostly code in C# (.NET) for my personal projects, but often work with C/C++,
JavaScript, and sometimes even Python, depending on what I am doing.

You can check out my portfolio/project blog site at
